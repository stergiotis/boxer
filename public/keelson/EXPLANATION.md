# keelson — the platform spine

`keelson` is the namespace under `public/keelson/` that gathers the *platform spine*: the runtime that hosts apps, the data-centrality glue that connects apps to ClickHouse and leeway, and the security model that mediates capability use. It is deliberately distinct from the apps it hosts (`apps/`) and from the ImZero GUI framework (`public/thestack/imzero2/`).

The name is the nautical term for the internal timber running along the inside of a ship's keel, tying the floor frames to it. The metaphor matters: the keelson is structural, *internal*, and invisible to passengers — apps and users see the surface (UIs, CLI), not the spine that distributes load underneath.

## Background

Before this namespace existed, the platform pieces lived alongside the apps and the GUI framework under a single historical prefix (`public/thestack/`). Three problems followed:

- **No visible boundary.** `ls public/thestack/` could not tell a reader which subdirectories were platform versus GUI versus app. Newcomers had to read `Manifest.Caps` files or trace imports to figure it out.
- **The GUI framework was leaving.** `imzero2` and `fffi2` were being upstreamed into boxer (since completed). The residue — the platform — needed an identity before that move, not after.
- **Apps had no home.** AppI implementations (`imztop`, `capinspector`, `capdemo`) lived under `thestack/` as siblings of `imzero2/`, indistinguishable from framework code.

[ADR-0035](../../doc/adr/0035-keelson-namespace-introduction.md) records the decision to introduce this namespace and the migration that landed it. The repo and the Go module path stay `github.com/stergiotis/boxer` — keelson is a *directory boundary*, not a module boundary.

## How it works

The namespace decomposes into three pillars, each a top-level subdirectory:

### `runtime/` — the Go monolith runtime

The pieces that ferry capability calls between apps and the in-proc bus, persist facts, mediate filesystem access, host windows, and manage the audit/heartbeat/lifecycle ledgers. See [ADR-0026](../../doc/adr/0026-app-runtime-and-capability-subjects.md) for the broader runtime contract and [ADR-0036](../../doc/adr/0036-runtime-buscodec.md) for the bus codec.

Packages inside: `app` (AppI, Manifest, Registry, LegacyFuncApp); `capbroker`, `persist`, `fsbroker`, `windowhost`, `inprocbus`, `buscodec` (brokers and bus); `factsschema`, `factsstore`, `rowmarshall` (fact schema, persistence, row-based leeway-shred marshal); `logbridge`, `logviewer`, `audit`, `heartbeat`, `runinfo`, `vocab` (observability and provenance).

### `data/` — data-centrality

Runtime-side ClickHouse glue. Lifted out of `runtime/` because these packages serve both runtime *and* app code (an app talks to chclient directly when it needs to issue SQL; the runtime uses chstore to persist facts). Keeping them as siblings of `runtime/` rather than nested under it makes the bidirectional consumption visible.

Packages inside: `chclient` (the SQL client); `chlocalbroker` and `chlocalpool` (the low-latency `clickhouse-local` worker pool — see [ADR-0028](../../doc/adr/0028-chlocal-low-latency-sql-cap.md)).

The *leeway* columnar protocol itself lives in `public/semistructured/leeway/`; it is consumed by both the runtime fact store and app code, but does not live under `keelson/data/`: leeway is a general-purpose protocol consumed across boxer, not a keelson internal.

### `security/` — capability enforcement

The cap-cross-checker. The runtime owns capability *mediation* (in `runtime/capbroker`); this pillar owns capability *enforcement* — the build-time check that an app's declared `Manifest.Caps` matches its static call graph.

Packages inside: `capslock` (the ADR-0026 §SD10 cross-checker). The `public/app/commands/capslock` binary is a thin shim that imports this package.

## Invariants

- **Repo and module path are stable.** `github.com/stergiotis/boxer/public/keelson/...` is the prefix for every package in this namespace. The repo name does not change to "keelson"; the Go module path does not change. Anything that depends on this remaining true should not be broken by future renames.
- **`keelson/runtime/` and `keelson/data/` are container directories.** No `.go` files live at those levels — only inside their subdirectories. Tooling that walks Go packages discovers `keelson/runtime/app`, `keelson/runtime/capbroker`, etc., not `keelson/runtime` itself.
- **`Manifest.Id` matches import path.** [ADR-0026](../../doc/adr/0026-app-runtime-and-capability-subjects.md) makes `AppIdT` equal to the full Go import path of the app's package. Moving an app changes its identity; this is acknowledged and accepted (the runtime is pre-stable, historical fact rows tagged by old AppId are orphaned by the keelson migration).
- **Apps do not live in `keelson/`.** Standalone AppIs live at `apps/<name>/`. The keelson namespace hosts the platform, not the things hosted on it.

## Trade-offs

- **Subdirectory vs. module rename.** Renaming the repo and `go.mod` to keelson would have communicated the boundary in every import statement, at the cost of touching ~53% of the tree, breaking downstream consumers (any sibling or external clone), and committing to a name change before it stabilises. The subdirectory boundary buys discoverability for a fraction of the cost and stays reversible. See [ADR-0035 design space](../../doc/adr/0035-keelson-namespace-introduction.md).
- **`data/` as a sibling of `runtime/` vs. nested under it.** The lift is intentional: nesting CH glue under `runtime/` reads "data is a runtime internal," but apps consume `chclient` directly. Sibling pillars make the bidirectional consumption visible. The cost is one extra layer in the path.
- **ImZero stays in `thestack/`.** Folding the GUI framework into keelson — disentangling it from its host topology — would be churn for no payoff. `thestack/` and `keelson/` coexist as siblings; keelson lives alongside ImZero, not inside it.

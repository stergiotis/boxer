# The play architecture

`play` is boxer's graphical ClickHouse SQL playground. Architecturally it is
a **reactive query-graph**: one SQL buffer splits into nodes, nodes execute
on demand-driven lanes, panels observe node results through typed channels,
and a signal store carries the live values — selections, viewports, time
extents — that flow between them as ordinary query parameters. This page
explains that shape and why it is this way; the end-user story lives in the
app's own help book (`apps/play/help/`), and each decision lives in its ADR.

## The premise: one buffer is the artifact

Everything derives from a single SQL text. The buffer — including its
`SET param_* = …;` prelude — is the reproducible artifact: copy it, paste
it, run it elsewhere, get the same query. The graph is *recovered* from the
buffer by static analysis (a nanopass CTE-lift and statement split), never
authored beside it; there is no separate pipeline definition to drift out of
sync. Explicit multi-cell authoring stays deferred until the single buffer
demonstrably fails someone (ADR-0097 SD12).

```

A CTE **is** a node — the node↔CTE isomorphism (SD13) means any CTE is
observable, and unobserved same-engine ancestors fuse back into one
pushed-down query for execution. Running the buffer executes the fused sink;
nothing is materialized server-side, and a node observed by several
consumers is recomputed per lane. That recompute-over-materialize stance
holds until shared observers measurably hurt (the SD13 trigger).

## Execution: demand-driven lanes

A lane is the async execution slot for one node: non-blocking `demand`,
last-good results while a run is in flight, cancel-and-replace supersession.
Every lane keys its memo on the **compiled pair `(SQL, params)`** — the same
SQL under different signal values is a different execution, and an unchanged
pair is a memo hit, never a re-run (minimality, SD1/SD4). Four lane kinds
exist, all the same machinery: the `main` lane (Run-gated, and the only one
carrying run history and the status-bar FSM), the observe lane (the Graph
view's all-panels override), per-node bound lanes (slice 6c), and the
panel-authored lanes (the Map's raster template, the Timeline's bands).
Everything executes over ClickHouse HTTP. Between a lane's compiled
`(SQL, params)` and the wire sits the pre-execute pass pipeline
(ADR-0108). The standard rewrites are `LW_ID_*` identity-macro expansion
(ADR-0106) and friendly leeway column-handle resolution (ADR-0116); play
front-loads a full canonicalisation so those consume a canonical shape,
and carries an opt-in selection-condition rewrite (ADR-0121) behind a
top-bar toggle. `BuildStatement` then lifts the top-level `SET param_*`
onto the URL channel and rewrites the tail to `FORMAT ArrowStream`: the
residual body is POSTed, the parameters and live signal values ride the
query string as `param_*`, progress (rows, bytes, memory) streams back
in the response headers while the run is in flight, and the result
arrives as an Arrow IPC batch. The Preview tab shows either face — the
buffer as authored, or this post-pass body as sent.

## The endpoint is a dialect, not a server

What `play` speaks on the wire — POST a statement, read `FORMAT
ArrowStream` back — is all it assumes of the far end, and
`--clickHouseUrl` names whatever answers it. Usually that is a real
ClickHouse. But the running shell serves the same dialect from its own
introspection facility (ADR-0094): env vars, registered apps, open
windows, the SBOM, and the live pass registry become Arrow tables built
from in-process snapshots, no ClickHouse server involved. Those tables
are named with the `keelson('…')` macro — itself a nanopass pass — and
it resolves two ways: the introspection endpoint's own engine expands
`keelson('x')` to the table directly, while against a real ClickHouse the
same macro rewrites to a `url()` reference that federates back to the
endpoint. Point the playground at the endpoint's `/query` path and it
browses the runtime's own state through the same editor, lanes, and
panels it renders data with — the tool observing itself.

## Signals: live values as unbound parameters

A `{name:Type}` placeholder the prelude does not bind is a **signal**: a
live, store-owned value shared by name across every query and panel (the
Grafana model, SD8). A `SET` for the same name *pins* it into a buffer-owned
constant that shadows the store — the two-tier truth model (slice-5 D1) that
keeps the buffer a self-contained artifact while panels write at interaction
rate.

```

The store is deliberately thin: raw strings plus provenance (who last
changed a value, at which revision — visible in the Graph tab's Signals
section, which is also where a human sets, adds, or discards one). Types
live in the *reading* slots; ClickHouse does the typed substitution
server-side, so there is no client-side literal-encoding surface. Liveness
is a per-node policy (D2): demand-driven lanes re-drive automatically, while
`main` stays Run-gated with an opt-in **Live** toggle and a staleness
witness that covers both buffer edits and moved signals. A referenced name
nothing fills blocks Run with a hint rather than a doomed request (D3).
History entries snapshot the signal values a run shipped, and restoring one
re-seeds the store (D4) — signals otherwise do not persist.

Selection is three signals, not one. A row click writes the ordinal cursor
(`selection`), the node it indexes (`selection_node`), and — when the
clicked result carries a leeway `id:id:…` column — the row's id *value*
(`selection_id`). The dispatcher stamps all three; panels are unaware. Reads
are node-scoped (a panel sees the cursor only when it indexes that panel's
node), the Detail tab follows `selection_node` by default, and
`{selection_id:UInt64}` cross-filters correctly regardless of node or
ordering because it is a key, not a position.

The Graph tab renders this whole picture live — a layered drawing
(constants and signals → query nodes → panel tabs, with the provenance
write-backs looping back) that relayouts only when the topology changes,
plus the writable Signals section and the per-node observe/bind controls.

## Tabs, panels, channels

Every dock tab is a registered `TabSpec`; the dock block is one loop (slice
6a). Result panels are the specs carrying a `PanelI` — typed input
channels, a pure per-channel accept/reject negotiation, and a render over
the filled channels (SD6) — while Editor, Preview, History, Snippets,
Graph, Diagnostics, and the Map register as chrome with no PanelI (SD7 as
structure; the Map is a driver over its own panel-authored node). The tab
set is instance-scoped and frozen at first render: an embedder customizes
it between construction and mounting via `Tabs().Add/Replace/Remove`, with
dock ids frozen so persisted layouts survive (built-ins 1..13, embedders
≥64). Two extension granularities stay deliberately distinct (D5): the
registry works at tab level; body-level hooks such as `SetDetailContent`
remain panel-owned seams.

Per-panel **bindings** (6c) point one tab at one split node: the tab's
frame view swaps to that node's lane view, its title names the node
("Table · recent"), and per-node loading/error present through the tab's
existing states. Bindings are presentation-side — Run still executes the
fused sink and the status bar keeps tracking `main`. They key on CTE names,
survive Runs, sit inert while a split lacks the name, and revive when it
returns.

## After the run: observable by construction

A query does not vanish when its lane settles. Every statement `play`
sends carries a compact `log_comment` stamp — `run_id`, `app`, `lane`,
and four content fingerprints: the buffer as authored, the body as sent,
the transform chain between them, and the parameter environment it was
applied to. That makes ClickHouse's own `system.query_log` attributable
with no boxer process running. The `queryrunsd` capture pipeline
(ADR-0115) then lifts each terminal log event into a `runtime.facts`
`QueryRun`, which the History and run-detail panels read back as ordinary
SQL. So History has two faces: the client-side ring of last-good lane
results, and this durable, cross-session server-side record. The whole
picture — a query's definition, environment, run, profile, and result
stored as leeway data in the same ClickHouse and traversable in both
directions — is the companion page's subject.

`queryrunsd` is a **separately-managed daemon, not something play
launches**. On a deployed box a hardened, loopback-only systemd unit
(`showcase/onbox/queryrunsd.service`, `Restart=always`) runs `main_go
queryrunsd` against a local ClickHouse; in development you run that same
verb by hand. Capture is optional and operator-enabled, and ClickHouse —
not the daemon — owns the schedule and the insert, so the durable
server-side face of History exists only where someone turned it on. With
no daemon, a finished run still stamps `system.query_log` (attributable
after the fact), but nothing lifts it into `runtime.facts`.

Those captured rows are leeway facts, not a flat table: the
human-readable, 20-column projection is machine-generated
(`queryrunfacts.ComposeHistorySql`), which the History tab runs and its
"Open as query" / "Profile events as query" buttons drop into the editor
verbatim. The raw selector is a single membership test — every `QueryRun`
fact carries the `KindQueryRun` membership in the symbol section's
label-reference array — so a one-line check that capture is flowing needs
no pivot:

```sql
SELECT count()
FROM runtime.facts
WHERE has(`tv:symbol:lr:lr:u64:2q:0:0:0::data`,
          6917529027641081896)  -- KindQueryRun (vocab.MembKindQueryRun)
```

## What is deliberately absent

- **A scoping subsystem.** Scope *is* the reference graph — a name is
  visible where a CTE reference reaches it. This guardrail is recorded with
  the prior-art survey in ADR-0097 (Superset's contrast).
- **Operator-level incremental view maintenance** (SD1). Node-level
  re-execution against ClickHouse is nowhere near the bottleneck.
- **Server-side materialization of shared intermediates** (SD13). Recompute
  per observer until it measurably hurts; the options are recorded.
- **Explicit multi-cell authoring** (SD12). The buffer-split carries the
  notebook feel without a second authoring surface.
- **A generalized wrappable-panel API.** One narrow body hook serves the
  one consumer; unification has a recorded trigger (slice-6 D5).

Each absence has a trigger in the ADRs; reaching for one of these means
re-reading the recorded reasoning first, not re-deriving it.

# ADR-0122: `play` kanban result pane — a board from a query result

## Status

Proposed, pre-human-review.

The pane (§SD1-3) is built: `play_kanban_panel.go` with its tests, the Kanban
dock tab and its `BOXER_PLAY_FOCUS_KANBAN` knob, `kanban.Model.SetSelected`, and
two snippet-library entries (the contract, and the `countIf` aggregation that
builds one).
Verified per §Validation — unit suites green, and a live run against a
`values()`-literal board confirmed the lanes, the tallies, the zero-tally skip
and the `@token` colours (the exported SVG carries the three legend swatches as
`#8bd28d` / `#e6b55d` / `#616466`, which are `adrboard`'s three legend tokens
exactly).

The corpus tables (§SD4) are **not built** — the pane is useful and testable
without them, and the tension recorded there deserves review before a provider
lands.

## Context

The `adrboard` app (ADR-0092) renders the ADR corpus as a read-only kanban
board: lanes are the frontmatter `status`, cards are ADRs, and each card carries
a packed tally of sub-item dots. It computes that board in Go —
`adrcorpus.ParseDir` into `[]Adr`, then `buildBoard` folds the corpus into a
`kanban.Model` (`apps/adrboard/board.go`).

Separately, `boxer adr` (`public/app/commands/adr`) already dumps the same
corpus to three Arrow files and binds them as the tables `adr`, `subtask` and
`coderef`, then runs canned SQL over them through `clickhouse-local`
(`query.go:83-89`). Its `overviewQueries` set already contains board-shaped
aggregations — the two-axis status × evidence board, and a per-`kind` sub-item
tally that is `cardDots` in all but the `GROUP BY` key.

So the corpus is *already* queryable, and the board is *already* expressible as
an aggregation. What is missing is a `play` panel that renders a result set as a
board, which would let the same corpus reach the same picture by a second,
declarative route.

That second route is worth having for its own sake. The two implementations are
a natural cross-check on each other, and the exercise makes an asymmetry visible
that neither route states on its own (§SD2).

Substrate facts that shape the design:

- `play` renders results through the ADR-0097 channel negotiation: a `PanelI`
  declares typed input channels, accepts or rejects the observed node's Arrow
  schema, and renders the claimed result. Panels are generic over schema — the
  World pane (ADR-0114) knows nothing about any dataset, only that it needs a
  column that country-resolves.
- The `kanban` widget is immediate-mode and host-owned: `NewModel(columns,
  cards)` retains the slices, `Render(Input{...})` draws, `RenderLegend` is a
  separate call. It caps a card at **3 dot kinds** and silently truncates beyond
  that (`render.go:366`); a `DotTally` whose ID is absent from `DotLegend` is
  silently skipped (`render.go:377`).
- Card widget IDs are scoped by card ID, so duplicate card IDs make every widget
  inside the second card warn. `adrboard` keys cards positionally for exactly
  this reason (`board.go:88`) — ADR numbers are not unique in the corpus.
- ADR-0116 resolves a **leeway column handle** typed as `section:column`.
  `splitHandle` claims any identifier with exactly one colon
  (`lwsql.go:316`). ADR-0121 adds `cond_N` result columns. Both are conventions
  over result column names, and a third convention has to not collide with them.

## Decision

A new `play` result pane ("Kanban" dock tab) that renders any result carrying a
lane column and a title column as a `kanban` board, plus three `keelson`
introspection tables that put the ADR corpus in SQL reach so the pane has a
worked example. The `kanban` widget gains one method (`Model.SetSelected`,
§SD3) and nothing else.

### SD1 — Panel contract: named columns, not detection

The pane is a `PanelI` observer of the active node (one required channel). It
claims a schema carrying, **by name**:

| column | type | required | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lane` | any | yes | the lane title this card sits in |
| `title` | any | yes | the card title |
| `subtitle` | any | no | the card's second line |
| `dot_*` | integer | no | a dot tally (§SD2) |

Detection was rejected. The World pane can detect its country column because
country-resolution is a strong signal; nothing distinguishes a lane column from
a title column but intent, and guessing between two string columns is a coin
flip. Named columns cost one `AS` per query — `SELECT status AS lane` — and say
what they mean. This follows the Map pane, which likewise requires
`mercator_x` / `mercator_y` by name rather than guessing.

The three text columns carry **no type requirement**. They are read through
`formatCell`, which is total over Arrow types, so a type check would reject
queries that would have rendered correctly — `SELECT num AS lane` is a board
with numbered lanes. Dot columns are the exception (§SD2): they are counts, and
a fractional or textual tally is not a weaker board but a meaningless one.

Lane **order** is first-seen row order, so the query's `ORDER BY` controls the
board's left-to-right layout with no second mechanism. Lane identity is
positional; so is card identity (row index + 1, non-zero because the widget
reads `ParentID == 0` as "no parent"). A result set has no guaranteed unique
key, and the widget's ID scoping punishes collisions — the same reasoning that
made `adrboard` positional.

The fold is **capped at 2000 cards**. A board is a tens-to-hundreds instrument;
without a cap, naming `lane` and `title` over a large table would lay out every
row. The excess is dropped and counted in the status line — not silently, and
not by rejecting, since a bounded look at a big table is a reasonable thing to
want on the way to a `GROUP BY`.

### SD2 — Dot contract: `dot_<label>` and `dot_<label>@<token>`

Any integer column named `dot_*` is a dot kind. Column order is dot order. The
legend label is the `<label>` part, so `dot_cited` legends as "cited".

Colour comes from the design system, named **in band**:

```sql
countIf(done)                       AS `dot_done@success`,
countIf(NOT done AND code_refs > 0) AS `dot_cited@warning`,
countIf(NOT done AND code_refs = 0) AS `dot_todo@disabled`
```

Without an `@<token>` suffix the colour falls back to the semantic ramp by
column position. An unknown token is rejected in `AcceptForChannel` rather than
defaulted, so a typo surfaces as a message instead of a wrong colour.

**On the separator.** `:` is taken: ADR-0116's `splitHandle` claims any
identifier with exactly one colon as a `section:column` handle, so
`dot_done:success` would be read as section `dot_done`, column `success`, and
sent to the leeway resolver. `_` is taken twice over — it is already this
convention's own prefix separator, and it is leeway's mangled-physical-name
separator (`detectSeparator`, `lwsql.go:331`).

The separator needs backtick-quoting in ClickHouse. That cost is already paid
elsewhere in `play`, where leeway physical names (`tv:symbol:value:…`) are typed
verbatim and ride through the pipeline quoted — and it is the *unquoted*
behaviour that picked `@` out of the candidates. Measured against
`clickhouse-local`, `@`, `~`, `/`, `!` and `?` all parse quoted and raise a
syntax error unquoted, so a forgotten backtick is caught at once. `#` does not:
it is a ClickHouse line-comment introducer, so `AS dot_done#success` silently
yields a column named `dot_done` followed by a comment — the board would draw
with a positional colour and no diagnostic. A convention whose typo mode is a
wrong-but-plausible board is not worth the mnemonic. Of the loud remainder `@`
reads as *at/as*, where `/` reads as a fraction and `!`/`?` carry the wrong
connotation. All candidates, `#` included, survive the nanopass lexer quoted
(verified against `nanopass.Parse`), so the grammar does not constrain the
choice — only ClickHouse does.

Zero tallies are not rendered — an ADR with no sub-items carries no dots, as on
the Go board. More than three `dot_*` columns is a **rejection**, not a
truncation: the widget would silently drop the fourth (`render.go:366`), and a
board that quietly omits a bucket is worse than one that says why it will not
draw.

**The asymmetry this exercise makes visible.** In Go, `cardDots` is a
first-match switch, and "an author's ✓ outranks code evidence" is implicit in
the case order:

```go
case s.Done:         done++
case s.CodeRefs > 0: cited++
default:             unknown++
```

SQL has no case-order precedence to inherit, so the same rule has to be written
out — `countIf(NOT done AND code_refs > 0)`. The Go version's precedence rule is
invisible in the code that implements it; the SQL cannot express the buckets
without stating it. Neither form is more correct, but the declarative one is the
one that cannot leave the rule unsaid.

### SD3 — Read-only, and the selection carries both ways

`ReadOnly: true`; `DrainMoves` stays unused. A `play` result is a query output —
there is nothing to write a dragged card back to, and inventing a
move-to-`UPDATE` path would make a query playground into a mutation tool on the
strength of a drag gesture. Clicking a card emits the `selection` signal for its
row, the same viewof duality the Table and World panes implement, so Detail and
Table follow the click. `dispatchPanel` stamps `selection_node` / `selection_id`
and provenance; the pane does not.

Unlike the World pane, the board also **follows** the signal, which needs one
new widget method: `Model.SetSelected`, the write side of the existing
`Model.Selected`. The pane reads the shared cursor before `Render` and reads the
user's own click back after. Emit-only was the smaller change and is wrong here:
the World pane has no selected state to contradict, but a board *paints* its
selection, so a cursor moved in Table would leave the board highlighting a card
nothing else agreed was current — showing a selection that is no longer true.
The method is three lines and a host that never calls it keeps the widget's
existing behaviour.

### SD4 — The corpus in SQL: three `keelson` tables

`keelson('adr')`, `keelson('subtask')` and `keelson('coderef')` expose
`adrcorpus` through the ADR-0094 introspection registry, carrying the **same
schemas and the same table names** `boxer adr` already binds
(`arrowemit.go:18-66`). That symmetry is the point: a query written against one
runs verbatim against the other, and `overviewQueries` becomes a set of `play`
snippets for free. A test pins the two schema sets equal so they cannot drift.

Freshness is **Live**: the corpus is files on disk that change under a running
process, which is why `adrboard` has a Reload button at all. A `Static` table
would go stale the first time an ADR is edited, silently.

Where no corpus resolves — a shipped binary running off-repo — the tables are
**empty rather than erroring**, following `keelson('build')` with no `runinfo`.

**Known tension: this crosses the line the other `keelson` tables hold.**
[ADR-0094](./0094-keelson-introspection-tables.md) founds the family on state
that "exists *only inside a running process*" — the env, the apps, the build,
the registered passes — not on what the repository contains. `keelson('adr')`
answers the second question, and it is the first provider to do filesystem I/O
at query time, which means its rows depend on where the process was started
rather than on what the process is. That was
accepted deliberately: the alternative (§Alternatives) puts a ClickHouse server
and a load step between a user and a board of the repo's own decisions, for a
dataset the binary can already parse in milliseconds. The mitigations are that
it never lies (Live freshness), it degrades quietly off-repo (empty, not an
error), and its root is pinned by an explicit env var rather than discovered
silently. If review finds the tension decisive, §SD4 can split into its own ADR
without touching §SD1-3 — the pane needs *a* table, not *this* table.

### SD5 — Deferred

The parent axis (`ParentID`, `GroupByParent`, `GroupByField`), `Column.IsDone`
(inert without parents — it exists to roll a child up into a done lane), lane
colour/accent, move-to-`UPDATE`, and caching the corpus scan behind an mtime
check. None of them changes the contract above. `Column.IsDone` and the parent
axis are one deferral, not two: the widget only reads `IsDone` for the rollup
the parent axis would introduce.

## Alternatives

- **A `demo/adr/` dataset loaded into a ClickHouse server** (the `demo/adsb`
  pattern) — the on-model answer, and rejected on ceremony: it needs a running
  server, a `setup.sql`, and a load step re-run after every ADR edit, to show a
  board of decisions the binary can parse in milliseconds. Kept in reserve; it
  is what §SD4 becomes if the keelson tension is judged decisive.
- **Server-side `file()` over the Arrow dumps** — reuses the existing dump
  verbatim with no ingest, but needs server filesystem access and a path policy
  that `RunQuery` sidesteps today by setting the working directory and using
  basenames. Rejected: a policy question in exchange for a saved `INSERT`.
- **Positional dot colours only** (no `@<token>`) — simplest contract, no
  separator question at all, and rejected because colour would be a property of
  where a column sits in the `SELECT`. Reordering a projection for readability
  would silently recolour the board.
- **`dot_<label>__<token>`** — a plain identifier needing no backticks, and safe
  from the leeway resolver (no colon, so `splitHandle` declines it). Rejected
  for reading ambiguously: in `dot_all_done__success` the label boundary is
  guesswork for a reader, where `@` is unmistakable.
- **`dot_<label>#<token>`** — the first choice, for the CSS-hex mnemonic.
  Rejected on measurement: `#` opens a ClickHouse line comment, so the unquoted
  typo is silent rather than loud (§SD2).
- **An ADR-specific board pane** — hard-wire the corpus and skip the contract.
  Rejected: every other `play` pane is generic over schema, and a pane that
  renders one dataset is an app, which is what `adrboard` already is.
- **A second `legend` channel** carrying `(kind, label, colour)` rows (the
  `chBands` pattern) — fully explicit and order-independent, but makes the
  simplest possible board a two-query affair. Reconsider if the `#<token>`
  vocabulary proves too narrow.

## Consequences

- `play` gains a fourteenth dock tab and a third result-column convention, after
  leeway handles (ADR-0116) and `cond_N` (ADR-0121). The three do not overlap by
  construction (§SD2), but the space of unclaimed column-name syntax is now
  visibly finite, and a fourth convention should probably prompt a shared
  registry rather than a fourth ad-hoc grammar.
- `adrboard` and the SQL board can disagree. That is the point — they are a
  cross-check — but it does mean two implementations of one picture, and a
  change to `cardDots` semantics now has a second site to update. The shared
  schemas (§SD4) keep the *inputs* from drifting; nothing keeps the *folds* in
  step but the corpus test.
- **The fold ports exactly; the chrome does not.** Run against the real corpus,
  the SQL board agrees with `buildBoard` on every card — lane, title, subtitle
  and all three tallies (§Validation). Three things the Go board does that a
  result set cannot express, all of them chrome rather than fold:
  - **An empty lane.** `buildColumns` emits the five lifecycle lanes
    unconditionally, so the board still says "nothing is withdrawn". A lane here
    is read off the rows, and a row is a card — so a lane with no cards cannot
    exist. This is structural, not an omission: the only fix would be a phantom
    card or a second channel carrying the lane inventory.
  - **Legend prose.** `dotLegend` gives each kind a sentence about what the
    colour claims ("a ✓ is the only claim of completion"). A column name carries
    a label, not a paragraph, so the legend names the column instead.
  - **A corpus headline.** `corpusSummary`'s one-liner has no slot in the
    contract; the status line counts cards and lanes.
  None of the three is reason to widen §SD1 today, but they are the honest
  answer to "can the query do everything the app does": the arithmetic, yes;
  the editorial, no.
- The `keelson` table family stops being uniformly about the running process
  (§SD4), and that boundary is now a judgement call rather than a rule.
- The board is capped at three dot kinds by the widget, with no headroom.

## Validation

- Unit (done): `AcceptForChannel` over synthetic schemas — missing `lane`,
  missing `title`, no `dot_*` (accepted, dotless board), four `dot_*` columns
  (rejected, §SD2), float tally, unknown `@` token, empty `@`, unlabelled
  `dot_`, and `@`-suffixed / bare `dot_*` mixed. Card and lane positional
  identity, first-seen lane order, the zero-tally skip, the 2000-card cap and
  its status line, the selection claim, and the fold cache — which is asserted
  to *preserve* a selection, since rebuilding the Model would clear it.
- Unit (with §SD4): the `keelson('adr')` / `('subtask')` / `('coderef')` schemas
  equal `arrowemit.go`'s, field for field; empty tables when no corpus resolves.
- Isomorphism (**done once by hand; not yet a test**): `buildBoard` dumped as
  rows and diffed against the snippet-library query over the same corpus
  snapshot, loaded from `boxer adr build`'s Arrow into a server. Every card
  agrees on lane, title, subtitle and all three tallies, and the lane inventory
  matches with its counts. Two traps it surfaced: the comparison must not run
  through TabSeparated, which escapes `'` and `\` in a title and reads as a
  false difference; and the two sides must be dumped at the same moment, since
  a first attempt disagreed on one ADR purely because a concurrent edit added a
  citation between the dump and the fold — the corpus moved under the read,
  which is the case for §SD4's Live freshness stated as evidence.

  This wants to be a standing test rather than a one-off. It cannot be, until a
  corpus table exists that a test can reach without a server (§SD4) — that is
  what §SD4 buys, beyond convenience.
- Integration (done): a scripted capture against a `values()` literal board —
  verifiable with no corpus and no ADR table — confirming the lanes and their
  counts, the per-card tallies against the source rows, the zero-tally skip, and
  the legend colours by their hex. Plus a live drive (egui inspection) through
  the whole loop: the snippet's **Replace** into the editor, Run, and a card
  click moving Detail to that row (row 3 of 8, `ADR-0114`) — the viewof duality
  in both directions.
